# SRI RAM AND HIS BELIEFS

![Bow and Arrows](img/bow_and_arrows.png)

* *Sri Ram* is considered by Hindus as a perfect man and his wife *Sita* as an ambodiment of a perfect woman.
* Many Hindus believe that *Sri Ram* is an *avatar* of Lord *Vishnu*.
	* *Avatar* comes from *Av* (down) & *Tra* (to passover) which means 'to descend down'. Some scholars say that it means `descent of a man who is in special relationship with GOD`.
	* *Vishnu* means '*The Sustainer*' which is another name of All Mighty GOD according to Hindu Scriptures [[Concept of God in Hinduism](http://a5221985.github.io/seeking_the_truth_site/site/concept_of_god_in_hinduism/)]. 
	* Therefore *Sri Ram* was a man sent by All Mighty God (as per the concept of Avatar)
* But many Hindus also believe that *Sri Ram* is All Mighty GOD, descended to earth in the form of a man. 
* In fact *Sri Ram* did not claim divinity as per scripture. He did not say that he is Almighty GOD. On the contrary, he said the following
	1. > "**Atmaanam kaarushyamanye Ramam Dasharathaatmajam**" (I am just an `ordinary human being`, I am `Dasharatha's son`) [Ramayanam, Sundarakanda]
* When *Sri Ram* was asleep, his *guru* (teacher) *Vishwamithra* woke him up with the following song
	1. > "**Kausalya supraja Rama purva sandhya pravarthate, uthishta narashardhula, Karthavyam daiva maanhikam**" (Oh Rama! Kausalya's endearing son! it is time of dawn. wake up! oh tiger among men! worshipping All Mighty GOD is the objective of your life) [Ramayanam, Balakanda]
* We also find that when *Sri Ram* was in a battle field, he remembered All Mighty GOD before shooting an arrow.

#### Other Hindu Scruptures about the Nature of All Mighty GOD
* The following verses describe All Mighty GOD as one who is `not embodied` or `one who has no body`.
	1. > **"sa paryagac chukram akaayam avranam asnaviram shuddham apapa-viddham
kavir manishi paribhuh svayambhur
yathatathyato 'rthan vyadadhac chashvatibhyah samabhyaha"** (Such a person must know in fact the Greatest of all (All Mighty GOD), `WHO is unembodied` [or `bodyless`], omniscient, beyond reproach, without veins, pure and uncontaminate, the self-sufficient Philosopher WHO is awarding everyone's desire since time immemorial.) [Yajurveda 40:8]
	2. > **"avyaktam vyaktim aapannam manyante maam abuddhayah param bhaavam ajaananto mamaavyayam anuttamam"** (Unable to comprehend MY imperishable, exalted and supreme state of being; `the spiritually deficient regard ME`, `the unmanifested as coming into existence.` [in a bodily form]) [Bhagavad Gita 7:24]

* Therefore to assume that All Mighty GOD has taken a body goes against Hindu Scriptures.

#### Conclusion
* We can come to the following conclusion that, *Sri Ram* did not claim divinity but he himself believed and worshiped All Mighty GOD according to Hindu scriptures.
